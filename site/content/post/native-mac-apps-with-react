## Hello world on macos

So I'm going to dive right into it.

Here's the project that I'm using to build my app - [react-native-macos](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-macos)

It's pretty straight forward to get started:

```bash
$ npm install react-native-macos-cli -g
$ react-native-macos init MyProject
$ cd MyProject
$ react-native-macos run-macos
```

Boom, you have a running mac app!


## The brief

So I love using slack! But!!!! The slack app kinda sucks. It's terribly slow and some of the reason for that is that it uses a webview. So why not leverage native capabilities and make a super speedy native app with ease (and JavaScript). So we're going to create a simple Slack client for macos.


## Step - 1 Authenticating a slack user

Seems pretty simple.


## This is all well and good but how do I make that into a standalone app?

Pretty simples, just follow these instructions:

1. Open XCode
2. Open Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme
3. Click on Info Tab > Select Build Configuration - Release
4. Close Modal and click on menu item Product > Build (or hit CMD+B)
5. When build has finished click on File > Project Settings
6. You'll see a folder there that is used for the build output (Usually something like 'DerivedData'). Click on the folder to find your build.
